# EPL Goals and Bookings Modelling
## Goals Model
Uses Poisson Distribution to predict number of goals scored based on historical data from season 22/23 so far.

## Bookings Model
Uses basic maths to attribute number of bookings per 90minutes per player.

This model is a work in progress, with plans to further segment the data by match rank and referee bias.
